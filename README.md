# Blackrock Web Framework

###### <br/>



## Introduction

Welcome to the second-generation ISNode Node.JS Web Framework - ISNode Blackrock (Aka: "Blackrock"). This version of the ISNode Web Framework takes what was built for ISNode (v1.0) and re-architects it from the ground up to make use of a Reactive (Event-Driven) Architecture AND to combine all major ISNode modules in to a single dependency for your next project.



**A quick scope of this framework includes:**

1. Single Node.JS Module w/ No Dependencies
2. Reactive (Event-Driven) From the Ground Up Through to Service Controllers
3. Scalable Interface Support (Built In: HTTP, WebSockets, SSH, ZeroMQ, NanoMSG)
4. Flexible Event Logging (to Console, Log File or ElasticSearch)
5. Single Application Server Supports Multiple Discrete Web Services Running Within It
6. Nested Controller Schema For Each Web Service Reflective of URL Path
7. Built-In Support for Mustache Views (HTTP Controllers)
8. HTTP Module Can Pipe Filesystem Files Transparently
