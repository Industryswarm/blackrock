# Service Filesystem Structure

###### <br/>

### Introduction

This is a quick guide into the ins and outs of developing and running services within Blackrock.

The Getting Started guide would have given you a simple introduction in to building a basic service. This guide, however will deep dive in to everything that you can do within services on the Blackrock Application Server.

### Primary (Root) Service Folder Structure

Each service on Blackrock shares a common folder structure. This section explains the expected folder structure or hierarchy for each service. We will delve deeper in to some of the secondary structures for the folders listed below later within this guide.
